# Programming with Golang

This repository documents my journey as a Java programmer to learn Golang

1. **Complete the [Programming with Google Go Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang) on Coursera** [README](https://github.com/meowpunch/programming-with-golang/blob/main/Programming%20with%20Google%20Go%20Specialization/README.md): This course covers the basics of Golang, including functions, methods, interfaces, and concurrency. I will also practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) by completing the assignments in the [Learn Go With Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) book.

2. **Delve into the LBC codebase with practical and advanced resources**:

   - [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go): A guide to writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
   - [uber-go/guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md): A style guide that provides recommendations for Go programming.
   
3. **Build a slack project to apply expertise and get hands-on experience**: Apply my newfound knowledge of Golang to build a project in Slack, which will allow me to gain hands-on experience and solidify my understanding of the language.

## Additional Resources

- **Seek out a community**: Joining a Golang community can be a great way to connect with other learners and experts in the field. You can ask questions, get feedback on your code, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in Golang. Here are some resources to consider:
